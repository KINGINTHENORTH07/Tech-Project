 Customer Finance Management System
Project Description

The Customer Finance Management System is a Java application designed to calculate monthly repayments for products bought on credit.
It features a `Customer` class to manage customer information and calculate repayments, and a `Finance_Period` subclass that adds functionality
for calculating interest if the repayment period exceeds three months. The `Customer_Finance` class tests both scenarios by prompting users for data 
and displaying repayment results with and without interest. This project helps manage credit repayments and provides functionality to handle different
repayment terms effectively.
